<p class="ex"; id="borderimg">Our Cottage Grove Neighborhood has a cat or two! There are groups of them called colonies that were here long before most of us first arrived. This site addresses one cat group&#8217;s history, and the important work that progressive, compassionate, and yes, City-of-Houston-Regulation-Responsible neighbors are doing to help manage these cat populations in preparation for the growth and change we know will continue to come to our neighborhood.

<strong>Just as we are a Community of Neighbors - these are a Community of Cats!</strong>
</p>
<h3> Community Cats</h3>
  &quot;Community cat&quot; is an umbrella definition that includes any un-owned cat. These cats may be &quot;feral&quot; (un-socialized) or friendly, may have been born into the wild or may be lost or abandoned pet cats. Some community cats are routinely fed by one or more community members, while others survive without human intervention. Whatever a cat&#8217;s individual circumstances, the term &quot;community cat&quot; reflects the reality that for these cats, &quot;home&quot; is within the community rather than in an individual household. They are social!
</br></br>
A colony can range from 3 to 25 cats. Their locations vary.  Community cat colonies can be in alleyways, parks, or neighborhoods. The Maxie Street Cat Colony is one such neighborhood colony.
</br>
<h3>The Maxie Street Cat Colony</h3>
The Maxie Street Colony is one of at least 3 managed colonies in Cottage Grove. There are no records of when this colony started, but we do know it was many years ago. The more recent years&#8217; observations of the colony reveal that the population tended to range between 12 and 20 members at any given time. Although the numbers were rather consistent, the members changed due to new litters of kittens, cats venturing away from the colony, or through death.
</br></br>

In the summer of 2013, the colony was registration with the City of Houston through the BARC Animal Shelter and Adoptions agency with three colony managers. The responsibilities of the colony managers are to care for the health and well-being of the cats while following the City&#8217;s ordinance in regard to having the cats spayed or neutered, feeding in such a way as to not attract raccoons or possums, and must have the permission of the property owner/manager to be feeding the cats.  At this point of time, every single member of the colony has been spayed or neutered and received a rabies shot at the time of being altered.

  <h3>Sign of an altered cat </h3>
</p>
<p>
Through diligence by the 3 colony managers and generous voucher assistance by <a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/trap-neuter-return" target="_blank">BARC&#8217;s Trap-Neuter-Return Program,</a> all the members of the Maxie Street Cat Colony have been spayed or neutered. If you look closely you will see the identifying notch in the left ear that marks altered feral cats. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
Through the management of the colony, the population of this colony has become stable with basically the same members since 2013. Studies show that once the community cats within a colony are spayed and neutered, not only will the population size gradually decrease, but the cats will also be healthier and coexist more peacefully within a neighborhood. Female cats, prevented from having any more litters, will be healthier. Male cats will gradually lose the urge to roam and fight, and will be less prone to injury. Behaviors associated with unaltered cats, such as yowling and marking territory with urine, will disappear.
