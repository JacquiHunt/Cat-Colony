  <h3>Black, white, tan, quite, loud, friendly, skittish . . . </h3>
</p>

<p>
  The Maxie Street Cat Colony consists of individuals with personalities as diverse as their very different coats. There are those that hang around the yard that they call home (home is where you are fed) to the roamers who visit every day or so. There are some that will occasionally allow you to reach over to pet them or who lovingly rub up on your leg or another cat to the real fraidy-cats that seem scared of everything.
</br></br>
The current group of about 17 cats has been the same members since 2013 and live in harmony. Because all the cats have been spayed or altered, the colony will not grow to replenish itself. In fact, over time as the numbers decline slowly one day the colony will cease to exist. </br></br>They do not fight over food because they are provided with it by the colony managers, nor do they fight over territory because they are not establishing families.

  <h3>Beta: The Matriarch</h3>
  Beta is a no-nonsense female who sits back and watches to make sure the colony is safe. She has been known to chase off aggressive dogs and invading cats from outside of the colony. Whereas she is observant of the comings and goings of the group, she does things on her own schedule. She always allows Big Black to have the first pile of food, but you would get the distinct impression that it is just that. He is allowed.
Beta had four litters before she was spayed. Several of the members of the colony call her MOM!
</P>

  <img src="images/Bustersmall.jpg" alt="Buster" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Buster: Loyal Companion </h3>
  Buster is one of the oldest in the colony. He has a husky voice that greets you every time you come around. He is also one of the most affectionate to the other members of the colony. He is sought out by other cats to rub against and to gain comfort. He has some Siamese marking and blue eyes. He was neutered prior to the colony being established.

  <h3>Blue has a different way of looking at things </h3>
  Every family has one! If there is going to be trouble, Blue will be in the middle of it! The old saying, &quotCuriosity killed the cat!&quot may just come true one day for Blue. He has been caught in the bottom of a large PVC pipe with no way out until he was rescued, has gotten into some kind of grime that lasted for weeks, and even showed up limping once almost unable to walk. He is one of the most inquisitive cats ever!
</p>

  <img src="images/stubs.jpg" alt="Stubs" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Stubs</h3>
  Stubs is from a litter of three born in 2012. Her siblings were able to be adopted, but she ran too quickly when it was time to catch her. It was her fate to remain part of the colony, and she has risen in leadership over the past few years.  She helps to fend off non-colony visitors as well as establish order to the group. Stubs gets her name because of a birth defect in which her tail comes to a sudden knobby end.

  <img src="images/black.jpg" alt="Hewey, Dewey, or Louie" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Hewey, Dewey, or Louie </h3>
  Hewey, Dewey, or Louie are identical triplets that never got their own identity. The first of these three black cats to show up is called Hewey, the second is Dewey and the last one is Louie. They are part of the wondering crowd meaning that one or two may not show up for every meal every day. They may even rotate who will be missing each day. Although they may wonder some, they don't go too far for they come back together every other day or so.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="images/callie.jpg" alt="Callie" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Callie </h3>
  Callie is the most cautious of the entire colony. When she was younger she was always in flight mode ready to flee the scene at the slightest sound or movement.  She is still very cautious, but will hang out more with the group and will come close when time to eat. She has the sweetest, softest voice and will engage in a conversation if she is settled enough to stay around. 
</p>
</br></br></br>

<p>
  <img src="images/callie2.jpg" alt="Callie 2" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Callie 2</h3>
  The second calico in the colony is called Callie 2. Although the two calicos were both born in the spring of 2013, they are not sisters. Furthermore, while the name is not too adventurous, this cat can be. She is one of the usual suspects when a &quot;treat&quot; of a dead lizard or field mouse is left in the driveway.
</p>
</br></br></br>

<p>
  <img src="images/white.jpg" alt="White 1, White 2, and White 3" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>White 1, White 2, or White 3</h3>
  Much like Hewey, Dewey and Louie, White 1, 2 and 3 are on a first come first name basis. There are no real distinguishing markings on the trio except for the direction in which they approach, and they all tend to show up for meals. Featured here, White 3 hangs out down the street to the right and is usually the last one to the dinner table, but he always shows. The other two white cats tend to come from the other direction. White 1 chills out under the neighbor&#8217;s house while White 2 lounges on the fence railing between houses. 
</p>

</br>
<p>
  <img src="images/bigblack.jpg" alt="Big Black" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Big Black</h3>
  Big Black gets his name for being the largest black cat in the colony. He has a small rip on his left ear just under the knotch that indicates he is neutered. Big Black has a wonderful personality similar to Buster&#8217;s. However, Big Black will allow petting for a few strokes before turning on you with his claws to say STOP IT! It sometimes appears to be that he does not want the other&#8217;s to see him acting domestic.

  <img src="images/patchesandspots.jpg" alt="Patches and Spots" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Patches and Spots</h3>
  Patches and Spots are sisters believed to be offspring of Beta.They have very similar markings, but the colors on Spots, shown on bottom, are darker. Patches received her name basicly from the large gray patch located on her nose. Both can be seen almost any day hanging around the house with Beta and Buster.

  <img src="images/motleycruise.jpg" alt="Motley and Cruise" style="float:left; margin:0 8px 0 0;" />
  <h3>Motley and Cruise</h3>
  Motley and Cruise are another set of sisters, but they have some very mixed colors. They both can blend in with their surroundings easily, and sometimes seem to appear from nowhere. Motley has the lighter colors and tends to be more of a home body. Cruise has the darker more mysterious markings which match her personality closely. While they get along with the entire colony, they can be seen hanging out together a lot. They are quiet and don't talk to people much like some of the other cats.
