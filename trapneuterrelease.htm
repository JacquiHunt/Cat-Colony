<p class="ex"; id="borderimg">According to Houston City Ordinance section 6-22, &quotIt shall be unlawful for any person intentionally to cause, suffer, or permit the maintenance of an attractive environment for the assembly of a congregation of unconfined and unlicensed stray cats or dogs by the placement of dog food or cat food,&quot however <strong>colony managers</strong> who follow city TNR guidelines are permitted to feed community cats &quotsubject to a trap, neuter, and return program approved by the Director.&quot

<h3>Why The Maxie Street Colony was Registered</h3>
<p>The Maxie Street Cat Colony was established a long time ago. However, it was only recently registered with the City of Houston through the <a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/get-involved-our-tnr-program" target="_blank">BARC program</a> in 2013. There was a genuine desire to help the cats of the community through feeding them and helping to stop the many litters of kittens. Once it was realized that only cat colony managers could legally feed the community cats, the forms were filled out to become managers. Furthermore, once involved in the process of being a colony manager, the many benefits to the cats as well as the community became clearer. Not only were the cats that were part of our neighborhood healthier, they had increased chances of living longer happier lives. By having all the members spayed or neutered, a conscious decision was made to help in a humane and effective way to do this small part of helping to control the over population of community cats in our neighborhood.</p>
<h3>BARC&#8217;s Trap-Neuter-Return Program</h3>
<P>  Community cats need the love and support of the community at large.  Learn about <a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/trap-neuter-return" target="_blank">BARC&#8217;s Trap-Neuter-Return Program.</a> It answers the questions of:
 <ul>
  <li>What is a community cat?</li>
  <li>What is Trap Neuter Return?</li>
  <li>Why is TNR Beneficial to Houston's Community?</li>
  <li>What is the alternative to TNR?</li>
  <li>Does putting community cats back into the community increase the risk for birds and wildlife to be harmed?</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<h3>Register to Become a Cat Colony Manager</h3>
<p>
If you are feeding community cats in your neighborhood, you should register to become a cat colony manager. The process is not a difficult one and is fully explained on BARC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/barc/get-involved-our-tnr-program" target="_blank">Get Involved</a>  page. From there you will find the requirements and the forms needed to apply to become a cat colony manager.
</p>
